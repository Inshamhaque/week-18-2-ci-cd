The frontend of publishing the blog. 
Some minute functionalities like Footers, The list which appears on searching.
Skeletons not added yet.

# If possible for a dark theme or provide a switch between them. 
# Signup/Signin Page ->  NextAuth implementation and profile extraction, profule creation also.
# Create Blog -> Look for editor if possible, Create blog logic not implemented, saving image in postgres. 
# Blogs/bulk page -> UI like hashnode just shift the blog in middle aur make it more subtle 
# Blog:id -> just find a way to import the image 
# Landing page ->
